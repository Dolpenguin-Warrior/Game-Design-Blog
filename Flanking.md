# Flanking in FPS Games

## What is Flanking?
So I have been thinking about one question recently, "What is flanking?". Flanking is sneaking around and backstabbing enemies, right?
Well I did some research and a flank is 
* "the side of a person's or animal's body between the ribs and the hip"

This doesn't seem to relate to first person shooters at all so I looked at the second definition.

* "the right or left side of a body of people such as an army, a naval force, or a soccer team"

Wikipedia had a page for the "flanking manouver" so I had a look at that. The opening lines say:
* "In military tactics, a flanking maneuver, or flanking manoeuvre is a movement of an armed force around an enemy force's side/flank to achieve an advantageous position over it. Flanking is useful because a force's fighting strength is typically concentrated in its front, therefore to circumvent an opposing force's front and attack its flank is to concentrate one's own offense in the area where the enemy is least able to concentrate defense."

Now none of these definitions seem to fit with our initial proposition that flanking is sneaking around and backstabbing enemies.
But the more I thought about it the more my perception of flanking changed, and the more I understood what a flank was. 
What all of these definitions have in common, is a weakness. The side of a body between the ribs and the hip is just soft flesh, attacking there will be more successful since there are no bones in that area.
The right or left side of a body of people tends to be weaker since they are generally focused in front, where the main action is. 
Finally Wikipedia's definition sums it up, its applying pressure on an enemy from a location which puts the enemy at a disadvantage. This is actually quite similar to sneaking around and backstabbing enemies.
It is attacking with an advantage from a location which gives you an advantage since the enemies attention is occupied from the front.

## Why does Flanking Work?

While I was thinking about flanking I realised a flanks success depends on 3 main factors:

1. Attention
1. History/Patterns
1. Information

### Attention

Humans are not multitaskers, even people who consider themselves multitaskers just switch between tasks more quickly then others. We cannot focus on more then one thing at once.
If a player is occupied doing something, be it fighting others or some other ingame task, then they will be easier to take unawares. They are much less likely to notice a flank if
they are engaged from the front. 

Someone who is looking for enemies will find a flanker much more easily. If the flanker has any attention on them their chances of successfully 
pulling off an attack go down drastically. But the attention being on the flanker is a double edged sword, it takes attention away from the main fighting force. If a player 
was engaging the enemy team and then they switch their attention to the flank, unless properly managed they leave themselves vunerable to the main team. 
This concept is called "pressure" where something takes attention away from the main team, forcing enemies to deal with it while also dealing with the team. 


Flanking can be successful by taking out enemies, but it can also be successful by appling pressure and creating an opening for the rest of the team to push in.

### History/Patterns

The human brain is a pattern recognition machine. It constantly looks for predictability in its environment and ways to capitalise on it. This can work in a flankers favour, 
but it can also work in the other teams favour.
If a flanker always takes the same route, attacks the same way, attacks from the same place, always attacks at the same time, etc. Then the other team can easily shut them down.
A predictable flanker is a useless flanker since the enemies know what to look for, when to look for it, and can figure out easily how to deal with it. 

This can also work in the flankers favour if they are unpredictable and adaptable. Flankers can create patterns and then break them at key moments to throw enemies off guard. 
They can also be unpredictable which forces enemies to dedicate resources to dealing with every possible way they could attack. Nobody can plan for everything and execute those
plans as new information is revealed. 

Therefore flanking can be successful if it is unpredictable and can actually be used in the other teams favour if it is predictable since it takes one player out of the equation.

### Information

Information is a key factor in executing flanks. This is where the "sneak behind enemy lines" part comes into play. The moment a flanker is revealed they start putting pressure
on the other team, but they can also be dealt with. A stealthy flank should deal damage **before** it is revealed, while a pressure flank should focus on making a presence without being killed.
This also comes into the pattern recognition part, a flanker can choose to reveal select information in order to misinform enemies or create fake patterns which leads enemies into
making mistakes based on bad information. 

Information can also come into play against smart enemies with good communication, if they know where the rest of a flankers team is then they can deduce they are being flanked and then deal with it.

So a flanker could be successful in an environment with proper teamwork by simply revealing the locations of the enemy team so that their team can create tactics for dealing with enemies.

Therefore there is 3 types of flanks which all revolve around information.
1. Stealthy Flanks
1. Pressure Flanks
1. Informative Flanks

## How does flanking relate to FPS games?

Well barring all the fundamentals of a flank which I have layed out above, flanking can be incredibly effective in FPS games. 
There are many types of FPS games and so I will go through a few of them with why flanking is useful and what impact it can have.

### Team Based Shooters (Overwatch, Sector's Edge, etc)
* Flanking involves either preset flank routes or routes developed midgame
* Suprise Enemies who are focused on the rest of the team
* Apply pressure giving team an advantage as 1-2 enemies go after the flanker turning the game into a 4v4 or 4v3
* Goal of a flanker is to apply pressure to give their team a man advantage rather then get kills
### Tactical Team Based Shooters (Counter Strike, Valorant, Due Process, etc)
* Flanking involves taking map control from enemies by pushing seperate to the team
* Taking advantage of enemies rotating towards the main team by pushing into areas of the map that get abandoned
* Can often win rounds by getting multikills on distracted enemies, or simply getting one frag and staying as pressure.
* Pressure flankers can prevent enemy rotations which gives the main team an easier time.

In every game flanking has a different purpose which leads
